# llwu/dotfiles

This is to reduce hassle in configuring across machines. Plus it's hard
to remember all of the tips and tricks copied from Stack Overflow/other
people's dotfiles ;) Feel free to copy some tricks from here as well
(of course, cloning every preference would be likely to cause headache
and is not recommended).

# Runs On:
* Machine 1: Windows (not configured), Gentoo + xmonad + st + fish + neovim
* Machine 2: OS X (now called macOS?) + iTerm2 + fish + neovim
* "Machine" 3: Debathena + mosh + tmux + bash + vim

- Neovim and neovim/python-client

##Â Important!

If no .tern-project file is found in the current buffer's directory that is

in the current working directory:

```vim

```

allowing ternjs use the default setup.


## Install

```vim
NeoBundle 'carlitux/deoplete-ternjs', { 'build': { 'mac': 'npm install -g tern', 'unix': 'npm install -g tern' }}
# or
Plug 'carlitux/deoplete-ternjs'
```

## Ternjs Configuration

[Tern configuration docs](http://ternjs.net/doc/manual.html#configuration).


## Vim Configuration example
```vim
" Use deoplete.
let g:tern_request_timeout = 1
let g:tern_show_signature_in_pum = 0  " This do disable full signature type on autocomplete
```

If you are using [tern_for_vim](https://github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim), you also want to use the same tern command with deoplete-ternjs
```vim
" Use tern_for_vim.
let g:tern#command = ["tern"]
let g:tern#arguments = ["--persistent"]
```

Also if you are using add loadEagerly - * many files * - this to your .bashrc or .zshrc, this will
allow you load all files you need when ternjs is started.

```bash
ulimit -n 2048
```
